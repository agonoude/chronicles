if this works properly i think i will, in order:
1. cry
2. eat a gluten free sugar cookie from sweet ali's
3. buy a build a bear

but i don't think it will work properly lol

note: all of the style is happening in html bc the style.css got WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY(coughs)YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too crowded last time and that was a nightmare.




all of my sources according to what i used + where i used it lol
